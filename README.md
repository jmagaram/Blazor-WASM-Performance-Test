# Blazor Web Assembly Performance Test

I'm interested in Blazor because I find programming in C# and .net to be much more pleasant than using React, Angular, TypeScript, etc. I've read there might be big performance problems with it, especially since it is all interpreted. So this project contains some quick little experiments to see how well it performs doing things like rendering hundreds of items in a list.
